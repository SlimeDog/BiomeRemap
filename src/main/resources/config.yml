#
# ========== CAVEATS AND WARNINGS ==================================================================
# BiomeRemap is provided for your enjoyment and entertainment. We cannot guarantee that the results
# will meet your needs or desires.
#
# The most important caveat: BIOME REMAPPING CANNOT BE REVERSED. Always backup the server before
# using this plugin, and test the functionality before you use it on a production server.
#
# BiomeRemap augments terrain generation by remapping biomes in the configured worlds as chunks are
# generated. Remapping previously generated chunks carries negative performance impacts and other
# potential risks. (For example, the underlying chunk populator may change, which could result in
# mismatched chunk or biome borders.) Consequently, BiomeRemap will not remap existing chunks
# automatically, even if the configuration is changed. They can be remapped manually, if desired.
# Commands to do so are described in the wiki.
#
# Due to the way Minecraft world creation and chunk generation work, BiomeRemap does automatically
# remap the chunks initially-generated on world creation. These chunks must be remapped manually.
# Commands to do so are described in the wiki.
#
# Thirteen (13) biomes were renamed in Minecraft 1.18. See the BiomeRemap WIKI for details.
# Renamed biomes are included at the bottom of the default overworld biomemaps for completeness,
# but they are no longer used as default replacement biomes. The renamed list is clearly marked in
# the biomemaps. It is expected that they will be removed from the configuration after testing.
#
# Twenty-five (25) biomes were deleted in Minecraft 1.18. See the BiomeRemap WIKI for details.
# Deleted biomes are included at the bottom of the default overworld biomemaps for completeness,
# but they are no longer used as default replacement biomes. The deleted list is clearly marked in
# the biomemaps. It is expected that they will be removed from the configuration after testing.
#
# Note that all biomes from 1.14 through 1.18 are included in the configured biomemaps, so this
# configuration file may be used on pre-1.18 servers. However, adjustments will be necessary.
# Biomes that do not exist in your Minecraft version will generate errors in the console/log,
# and BiomeRemap will fail to enable. If you are using this configuration on a pre-1.18 server,
# delete the offending entries, then reload the plugin or restart the server.
#
# Changes of this magnitude should always be performed first on a test server, in order to verify
# that the configuration and results meet expectations. We strongly recommend making a server backup
# before installing and using any new plugin.

# ========== CONFIGURATION FILE VERSION ============================================================
# Do not edit the version string unless you know what you are dolng.
file: config.yml
version: 5

# ========== CHECK FOR UPDATES =====================================================================
# If you do not want notification of available updates in the console log, you may disable it here.
check-for-updates: true

# ========== BSTATS METRICS ========================================================================
# By default, the plugin collects and transmits anonymous statistics to bstats.org.
# Data collection may be disabled here, or generally in the bStats/config.yml.
#
enable-metrics: true

# ========== BIOMEMAP CONFIGURATION ================================================================
# The main configuration is a list of biomemaps, enabled in specific world(s).
# Each biomemap contains a list of assigned worlds, and a list of biomes with replacement-biomes.
#
# biomemaps:
#   NAME:
#     description: TEXT
#     enabled-worlds: LIST
#     full-chunk-remap: true|false (default:false)
#     biomes:
#        BIOME_ENUM:
#         replacement-biome: BIOME_ENUM
#
# biomemaps.NAME
#   * required, unique
#   * identifies a biomemap
#   * multiple biomemaps may be defined, and subsets of worlds assigned to them
#   * snowbound and boilerroom sample biomemaps are included in the default configuration
# biomemaps.NAME.description
#   * optional, for reference only
# biomemaps.NAME.enabled-worlds
#   * required, a list of assigned worlds
#   * a world may be assigned to more than one biomemap, if you understand the consequences
#   * may be the empty set [] if no worlds are assigned
#   * overlapping combinations of worlds and biomes will generate non-fatal warnings in the console/log
# biomemaps.NAME.full-chunk-remap
#   * Prior to MC 1.16.2, "chunk" referred to a 16x16 column, across all Y values; the biome of the
#     entire column was specified by a single BIOME_ENUM value in the base chunk (Y=0).
#   * Starting with MC 1.16.2, "chunk" refers to a 16x16x16 cube; the biome of each cubic chunk may
#     be specified independently. BiomeRemap addresses this change in the following way:
#        * biomemaps.NAME.full-chunk-remap: false (default)
#          Only the base chunk (Y=0) will be remapped. This changes weather (for example, rain vs.
#          snow) in the entire column, but changes the visual characteristics (for example, grass
#          color) in the base chunk only. So the surface terrain characteristics remain unchanged.
#        * biomemaps.NAME.full-chunk-remap: true
#          The entire column will be remapped. This changes weather in the same way, but changes the
#          the visual characteristics of the entire column, so the surface terrain characteristics
#          will reflect the new biome. This will incur a small additional computational cost to loop
#          through the entire column, but it should not be noticeable in practice, and will not affect
#          game play if the chunks are pre-generated (which we recommend in any event).
#   * WARNING: The configuration should be changed only after careful consideration and testing. The
#     consequences of TRUE cannot be reversed, except by regenerating chunks after reverting to FALSE.
# biomemaps.NAME.biomes.BIOME_ENUM
#   * Required, unique per biomemap
#   * Identifies the vanilla biome that will be replaced
#   * An invalid biome ENUM will generate a non-fatal warning in the console/log
#   * Valid biome ENUMs may be found at https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/bukkit/org/bukkit/block/Biome.html
#     but we use lowercase, which may be found at https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Biome
#   * Biome descriptions may be found at https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Biome
#   * Additional information may be found at https://github.com/SlimeDog/BiomeRemap/wiki/
# biomemaps.NAME.biomes.BIOME_ENUM.replacement-biome
#   * Optional
#   * If present, defines the replacement biome
#   * If replacement is not defined for any biome, the biome will not be replaced
#   * An invalid biome ENUM will generate a non-fatal warning in the console/log, and revert to the named biome
#
# Other configuration nodes may be added, as usage warrants.
