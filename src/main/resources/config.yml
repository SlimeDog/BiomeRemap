# Remap biomes to create strange new worlds.

# Design: SlimeDog
# Implementation: drives_a_ford
# Testing: SlimeDog

# Spigot version support: 1.14.4     Use BiomeRemap-1.0.1
# Spigot version support: 1.15.x     Use BiomeRemap-2.0.x
#
# ========== CAVEATS AND WARNINGS ==================================================================
# BiomeRemap is provided for your enjoyment and entertainment. We cannot guarantee that the results
# will meet your needs or desires.
#
# The most important caveat: BIOME REMAPPING CANNOT BE REVERSED. Always backup the server before
# using this plugin, and test the functionality before you use it on a production server.
#
# BiomeRemap augments terrain generation by remapping biomes in the configured worlds as chunks are
# generated. Remapping previously generated chunks carries negative performance impacts and other
# potential risks. (For example, the underlying chunk populator may change, which could result in
# mismatched chunk or biome borders.) Consequently, BiomeRemap will not remap existing chunks
# automatically, even if the configuration is changed. They can be remapped manually, if desired.
# Commands to do so are described in the wiki.
#
# Due to the way Spigot world creation and chunk generation work, BiomeRemap cannot automatically
# remap the chunks initially-generated on world creation. These chunks must be remapped manually.
# Commands to do so are described in the wiki.
#
# Note that all 1.14/1.15 biomes are included in the configured biomemaps. Biomes that do not exist
# in your Spigot version will generate warnings in the console/log on server start-up; these may be
# safely ignored.
#
# Changes of this magnitude should always be performed first on a test server, in order to verify
# that the configuration and results meet expectations. We strongly recommend making a server backup
# before installing and using any new plugin.

# ========== CONFIGURATION FILE VERSION ============================================================
# Do not edit the version string unless you know what you are dolng.
file: config.yml
version: 2

# ========== CHECK FOR UPDATES =====================================================================
# If you do not want available updates announced in the console log, you may disable it here.
check-for-updates: true

# ========== BSTATS METRICS ========================================================================
# By default, the plugins collects and transmits anonymous statistics to bstats.org.
# Data collection may be disabled here, or generally in the bStats/config.yml.
#
enable-metrics: true

# ========== BIOMEMAP CONFIGURATION ================================================================
# The main configuration is a list of biomemaps, enabled in specific world(s).
# Each biomemap contains a list of assigned worlds, and a list of biomes with replacement-biomes.
#
# biomemaps:
#   NAME:
#     description: TEXT
#     enabled-worlds: LIST
#     biomes:
#        BIOME_ENUM:
#         replacement-biome: BIOME_ENUM
#
# biomeremap.NAME
#   * required, unique
#   * identifies a biomemap
#   * multiple biomemaps may be defined, and subsets of worlds assigned to them
#   * snowbound and boilerroom sample biomemaps are included in the default configuration
# biomeremap.NAME.description
#   * optional, for reference only
# biomeremap.NAME.enabled-worlds
#   * required, a list of assigned worlds
#   * a world may be assigned to more than one biomemap, if you understand the consequences
#   * may be the empty set [] if no worlds are assigned
#   * overlapping combinations of worlds and biomes will generate non-fatal warnings in the console/log

# biomes.BIOME_ENUM
#   * required, unique per biomemap
#   * identifies the vanilla biome that will be replaced
#   * an invalid biome ENUM will generate a non-fatal warning in the console/log
#   * valid biome ENUMs may be found at https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/bukkit/org/bukkit/block/Biome.html
#   * biome descriptions may be found at https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Biome
#   * additional information may be found at https://github.com/SlimeDog/BiomeRemap/wiki/
# biomes.BIOME_ENUM.replacement-biome
#   * optional
#   * if present, defines the replacement biome
#   * if replacement is not defined for any biome, the biome will not be replaced
#   * an invalid biome ENUM will generate a non-fatal warning in the console/log, and revert to the named biome
#
# Other configuration nodes may be added, as usage warrants.
